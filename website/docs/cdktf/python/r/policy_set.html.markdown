# tfe_policy_set

Policies are rules enforced on Terraform runs. Two policy-as-code frameworks are
integrated with Terraform Enterprise: Sentinel and Open Policy Agent (OPA).

Policy sets are groups of policies that are applied together to related workspaces.
By using policy sets, you can group your policies by attributes such as environment
or region. Individual policies that are members of policy sets will only be checked
for workspaces that the policy set is attached to.

## Example Usage

Basic usage (VCS-based policy set):

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.policy_set import PolicySet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        PolicySet(self, "test",
            agent_enabled="true",
            description="A brand new policy set",
            kind="sentinel",
            name="my-policy-set",
            organization="my-org-name",
            policies_path="policies/my-policy-set",
            policy_tool_version="0.24.1",
            vcs_repo=PolicySetVcsRepo(
                branch="main",
                identifier="my-org-name/my-policy-set-repository",
                ingress_submodules=False,
                oauth_token_id=Token.as_string(tfe_oauth_client_test.oauth_token_id)
            ),
            workspace_ids=[Token.as_string(tfe_workspace_test.id)]
        )
```

Using manually-specified policies:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.policy_set import PolicySet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        PolicySet(self, "test",
            agent_enabled="true",
            description="A brand new policy set",
            kind="sentinel",
            name="my-policy-set",
            organization="my-org-name",
            policy_ids=[Token.as_string(tfe_sentinel_policy_test.id)],
            policy_tool_version="0.24.1",
            workspace_ids=[Token.as_string(tfe_workspace_test.id)]
        )
```

Manually uploaded policy set, in lieu of VCS:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.data_tfe_slug import DataTfeSlug
from imports.tfe.policy_set import PolicySet
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test = DataTfeSlug(self, "test",
            source_path="policies/my-policy-set"
        )
        tfe_policy_set_test = PolicySet(self, "test_1",
            description="A brand new policy set",
            name="my-policy-set",
            organization="my-org-name",
            slug=Token.as_string_map(test),
            workspace_ids=[Token.as_string(tfe_workspace_test.id)]
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        tfe_policy_set_test.override_logical_id("test")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the policy set.
* `description` - (Optional) A description of the policy set's purpose.
* `global` - (Optional) Whether or not policies in this set will apply to
  all workspaces. Defaults to `false`. This value _must not_ be provided if
  `workspace_ids` is provided.
* `kind` - (Optional) The policy-as-code framework associated with the policy.
   Defaults to `sentinel` if not provided. Valid values are `sentinel` and `opa`.
   A policy set can only have policies that have the same underlying kind.
* `agent_enabled` - (Optional) Whether or not the policy set is run as a policy evaluation within the agent. 
   True by default for all "opa" policy sets.
* `policy_tool_version` - (Optional) The policy tool version to run the evaluation against.
* `overridable` - (Optional) Whether or not users can override this policy when
   it fails during a run. Defaults to `false`. Only valid for OPA policies.
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `policies_path` - (Optional) The sub-path within the attached VCS repository
  to ingress when using `vcs_repo`. All files and directories outside of this
  sub-path will be ignored. This option can only be supplied when `vcs_repo` is
  present. Forces a new resource if changed.
* `policy_ids` - (Optional) A list of Sentinel policy IDs. This value _must not_ be provided
  if `vcs_repo` is provided.
* `vcs_repo` - (Optional) Settings for the policy sets VCS repository. Forces a
  new resource if changed. This value _must not_ be provided if `policy_ids` are provided.
* `workspace_ids` - (Optional) A list of workspace IDs. This value _must not_ be provided
  if `global` is provided.
* `slug` - (Optional) A reference to the `tfe_slug` data source that contains
  the `source_path` to where the local policies are located. This is used when
policies are located locally, and can only be used when there is no VCS repo or
explicit Policy IDs. This _requires_ the usage of the `tfe_slug` data source.

-> **Note:** When neither `vcs_repo` or `policy_ids` is not specified, the current
default is to create an empty non-VCS policy set.

The `vcs_repo` block supports:

* `identifier` - (Required) A reference to your VCS repository in the format
  `<vcs organization>/<repository>` where `<vcs organization>` and `<repository>` refer to the organization and repository
  in your VCS provider.
* `branch` - (Optional) The repository branch that Terraform will execute from.
  This defaults to the repository's default branch (e.g. main).
* `ingress_submodules` - (Optional) Whether submodules should be fetched when
  cloning the VCS repository. Defaults to `false`.
* `oauth_token_id` - (Optional) Token ID of the VCS Connection (OAuth Connection Token) to use. This conflicts with `github_app_installation_id` and can only be used if `github_app_installation_id` is not used.
* `github_app_installation_id` - (Optional) The installation id of the Github App. This conflicts with `oauth_token_id` and can only be used if `oauth_token_id` is not used.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the policy set.

## Import

Policy sets can be imported; use `<POLICY SET ID>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_policy_set.test polset-wAs3zYmWAhYK7peR
```

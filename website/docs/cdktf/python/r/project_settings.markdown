# tfe_project_settings

**Requires Terraform CLI version 1.0 and later**

Use this resource to manage Project Settings.

Primarily, this resource allows setting default execution mode and agent pool for all workspaces within a project. When not specified, the organization defaults will be used.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.agent_pool import AgentPool
from imports.tfe.organization import Organization
from imports.tfe.project import Project
from imports.tfe.project_settings import ProjectSettings
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test = Organization(self, "test",
            default_execution_mode="remote",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        my_project = Project(self, "my_project",
            name="my-project",
            organization=test.name
        )
        my_agents = AgentPool(self, "my_agents",
            name="my-agent-pool",
            organization=test.name
        )
        ProjectSettings(self, "my_project_settings",
            default_agent_pool_id=my_agents.id,
            default_execution_mode="agent",
            project_id=my_project.id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
* `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the project to manage settings for.
* `default_execution_mode` - (Optional) Which [execution mode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#execution-mode)
  to use as the default for all workspaces in the project. Valid values are `remote`, `local` or `agent`.
* `default_agent_pool_id` - (Optional) The ID of an agent pool to assign to the workspace. Requires `default_execution_mode` to be set to `agent`. This value _must not_ be provided if `default_execution_mode` is set to any other value.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:
* `overwrites` - Can be used to check whether a setting is currently inheriting its value from the organization.
  - `default_execution_mode` - Set to `true` if the default execution mode of the project is being determined by the setting on the project itself. It will be `false` if the execution mode is inherited from another resource (e.g. the organization's default execution mode)
  - `default_agent_pool_id` - Set to `true` if the default agent pool of the project is being determined by the setting on the project itself. It will be `false` if the agent pool is inherited from another resource (e.g. the organization's default agent pool)parent project.

## Import

Project settings  can be imported; use the `<PROJECT_ID>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_project_settings.my_project_settings <PROJECT_ID>
```

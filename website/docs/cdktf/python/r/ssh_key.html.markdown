# tfe_ssh_key

This resource represents an SSH key which includes a name and the SSH private
key. An organization can have multiple SSH keys available.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe.ssh_key.SshKey(self, "test",
            key="private-ssh-key",
            name="my-ssh-key-name",
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name to identify the SSH key.
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `key` - (Required) The text of the SSH private key.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` The ID of the SSH key.

## Import

Because the Terraform Enterprise API does not return the private SSH key
content, this resource cannot be imported.

# tfe_ssh_key

This resource represents an SSH key which includes a name and the SSH private
key. An organization can have multiple SSH keys available.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe.ssh_key.SshKey(self, "test",
            key="private-ssh-key",
            name="my-ssh-key-name",
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name to identify the SSH key.
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `key` - (Optional) The text of the SSH private key. One of `key` or `key_wo`
  must be provided.
* `key_wo` - (Optional, [Write-Only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.11.x/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The text of the SSH private key, guaranteed not to be
  written to plan or state artifacts. One of `key` or `key_wo` must be provided.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` The ID of the SSH key.

## Import

Because the Terraform Enterprise API does not return the private SSH key
content, this resource cannot be imported.

-> **Note:** Write-Only argument `key_wo` is available to use in place of `key`. Write-Only arguments are supported in HashiCorp Terraform 1.11.0 and later. [Learn more](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.11.x/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments).

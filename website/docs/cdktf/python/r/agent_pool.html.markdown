# tfe_agent_pool

An agent pool represents a group of agents, often related to one another by sharing a common
network segment or purpose. A workspace may be configured to use one of the organization's agent
pools to run remote operations with isolated, private, or on-premises infrastructure.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe_organization_test_organization = tfe.organization.Organization(self, "test-organization",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        tfe.agent_pool.AgentPool(self, "test-agent-pool",
            name="my-agent-pool-name",
            organization=cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_organization_test_organization.name),
            organization_scoped=True
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the agent pool.
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `organization_scoped` - (Optional) Whether or not the agent pool is scoped to all workspaces in the organization. Defaults to `true`. Should be `false` when limiting workspaces that can use the agent pool with the [tfe_agent_pool_allowed_workspaces](agent_pool_allowed_workspaces.html) resource.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the agent pool.
* `name` - The name of agent pool.
* `organization` - The name of the organization associated with the agent pool.

## Import

Agent pools can be imported; use `<AGENT POOL ID>` or `<ORGANIZATION NAME>/<AGENT POOL NAME>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_agent_pool.test apool-rW0KoLSlnuNb5adB
```

```shell
terraform import tfe_workspace.test my-org-name/my-agent-pool-name
```

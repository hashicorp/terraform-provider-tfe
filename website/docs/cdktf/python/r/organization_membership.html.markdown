# tfe_organization_membership

Add or remove a user from an organization.

~> **NOTE:** This resource requires using the provider with HCP Terraform or
an instance of Terraform Enterprise at least as recent as v202004-1.

~> **NOTE:** This resource cannot be used to update an existing user's email address
since users themselves are the only ones permitted to update their email address.
If a user updates their email address, configurations using the email address should
be updated manually.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.

import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe.organization_membership.OrganizationMembership(self, "test",
            email="user@company.com",
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.

* `id` - The organization membership ID.
* `user_id` - The ID of the user associated with the organization membership.

## Import

Organization memberships can be imported using an identity. For example:

```hcl
import {
  to = tfe_organization_membership.test
  identity = {
    id       = "ou-12345678"
    hostname = "app.terraform.io"
  }

```

example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_organization_membership.test my-org-name/user@example.com
```

```shell
terraform import tfe_organization_membership.test ou-wAs3zYmWAhYK7peR

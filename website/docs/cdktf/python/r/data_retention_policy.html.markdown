# tfe_data_retention_policy

Creates a data retention policy attached to either an organization or workspace. This resource is for Terraform Enterprise only.

## Example Usage

Creating a data retention policy for a workspace:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe_organization_test_organization = tfe.organization.Organization(self, "test-organization",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        tfe_workspace_test_workspace = tfe.workspace.Workspace(self, "test-workspace",
            name="my-workspace-name",
            organization=cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_organization_test_organization.name)
        )
        tfe.data_retention_policy.DataRetentionPolicy(self, "foobar",
            delete_older_than=[{
                "days": 42
            }
            ],
            workspace_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_workspace_test_workspace.id)
        )
```

Creating a data retention policy for an organization:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe_organization_test_organization = tfe.organization.Organization(self, "test-organization",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        tfe.data_retention_policy.DataRetentionPolicy(self, "foobar",
            delete_older_than=[{
                "days": 1138
            }
            ],
            organization=cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_organization_test_organization.name)
        )
```

Creating a data retention policy for an organization and exclude a single workspace from it:

```hcl
resource "tfe_organization" "test-organization" {
  name  = "my-org-name"
  email = "admin@company.com"
}

// create data retention policy the organization
resource "tfe_data_retention_policy" "foobar" {
  organization = tfe_organization.test-organization.name

  delete_older_than {
    days = 1138
  }
}

resource "tfe_workspace" "test-workspace" {
  name         = "my-workspace-name"
  organization = tfe_organization.test-organization.name
}

// create a policy that prevents automatic deletion of data in the test-workspace
resource "tfe_data_retention_policy" "foobar" {
  workspace_id = tfe_workspace.test-workspace.id

  dont_delete {}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `organization` - (Optional) The name of the organization you want the policy to apply to. Must not be set if `workspace_id` is set.
* `workspace_id` - (Optional) The ID of the workspace you want the policy to apply to. Must not be set if `organization` is set.
* `delete_older_than` - (Optional) If this block is set, the created policy will apply to any data older than the configured number of days. Must not be set if `dont_delete` is set.
* `dont_delete` - (Optional) If this block is set, the created policy will prevent other policies from deleting data from this workspace or organization. Must not be set if `delete_older_than` is set.


## Import

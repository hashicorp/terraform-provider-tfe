# tfe_data_retention_policy

Creates a data retention policy attached to either an organization or workspace. This resource is for Terraform Enterprise only.

## Example Usage

Creating a data retention policy for a workspace:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.data_retention_policy import DataRetentionPolicy
from imports.tfe.organization import Organization
from imports.tfe.workspace import Workspace
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, dontDelete):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test_organization = Organization(self, "test-organization",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        test_workspace = Workspace(self, "test-workspace",
            name="my-workspace-name",
            organization=test_organization.name
        )
        DataRetentionPolicy(self, "foobar",
            delete_older_than=[{
                "days": 42
            }
            ],
            workspace_id=test_workspace.id,
            dont_delete=dont_delete
        )
```

Creating a data retention policy for an organization:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.data_retention_policy import DataRetentionPolicy
from imports.tfe.organization import Organization
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, dontDelete):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test_organization = Organization(self, "test-organization",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        DataRetentionPolicy(self, "foobar",
            delete_older_than=[{
                "days": 1138
            }
            ],
            organization=test_organization.name,
            dont_delete=dont_delete
        )
```

Creating a data retention policy for an organization and exclude a single workspace from it:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.data_retention_policy import DataRetentionPolicy
from imports.tfe.organization import Organization
from imports.tfe.workspace import Workspace
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name, *, dontDelete):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test_organization = Organization(self, "test-organization",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        test_workspace = Workspace(self, "test-workspace",
            name="my-workspace-name",
            organization=test_organization.name
        )
        DataRetentionPolicy(self, "foobar",
            delete_older_than=[{
                "days": 1138
            }
            ],
            organization=test_organization.name,
            dont_delete=dont_delete
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `organization` - (Optional) The name of the organization you want the policy to apply to. Must not be set if `workspace_id` is set.
* `workspace_id` - (Optional) The ID of the workspace you want the policy to apply to. Must not be set if `organization` is set.
* `delete_older_than` - (Optional) If this block is set, the created policy will apply to any data older than the configured number of days. Must not be set if `dont_delete` is set.

# tfe_organization_module_sharing

Manage module sharing for an organization. This resource requires the
use of an admin token and is for Terraform Enterprise only.

-> **NOTE:** `tfe_organization_module_sharing` is deprecated in favor of using `tfe_admin_organization_settings` which also allows the management of the global module sharing setting. They attempt to manage the same resource and are mutually exclusive.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.organization_module_sharing import OrganizationModuleSharing
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        OrganizationModuleSharing(self, "test",
            module_consumers=["my-org-name-2", "my-org-name-3"],
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `module_consumers` - (Required) Names of the organizations to consume the module registry.

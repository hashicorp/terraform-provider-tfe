# tfe_team_organization_members

Add or remove one or more team members using a
[tfe_organization_membership](organization_membership.html).

~> **NOTE** on managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides four
resources for managing team memberships. This - along with [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) - is the preferred method as it
allows you to add members to a team by email addresses. The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) is used to manage a single team membership whereas [tfe_team_organization_members](team_organization_members.html) is used to manage all team memberships at once. All four resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

~> **NOTE:** This resource requires using the provider with HCP Terraform or
an instance of Terraform Enterprise at least as recent as v202004-1.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe_organization_membership_sample =
        tfe.organization_membership.OrganizationMembership(self, "sample",
            email="sample@hashicorp.com",
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
        tfe_organization_membership_test =
        tfe.organization_membership.OrganizationMembership(self, "test",
            email="example@hashicorp.com",
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
        tfe_team_test = tfe.team.Team(self, "test_2",
            name="my-team-name",
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        tfe_team_test.override_logical_id("test")
        tfe_team_organization_members_test =
        tfe.team_organization_members.TeamOrganizationMembers(self, "test_3",
            organization_membership_ids=[
                cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_organization_membership_test.id),
                cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_organization_membership_sample.id)
            ],
            team_id=cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_team_test.id)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        tfe_team_organization_members_test.override_logical_id("test")
```

With a set of organization members:

```hcl
locals {
  all_users = toset([
    "user1@hashicorp.com",
    "user2@hashicorp.com",
  ])
}

resource "tfe_team" "test" {
  name         = "my-team-name"
  organization = "my-org-name"
}

resource "tfe_organization_membership" "all_membership" {
  organization = "my-org-name"
  for_each     = local.all_users
  email        = each.key
}

resource "tfe_team_organization_members" "test" {
  team_id = tfe_team.test.id
  organization_membership_ids = [for member in local.all_users : tfe_organization_membership.all_membership[member].id]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `team_id` - (Required) ID of the team.
* `organization_membership_ids` - (Required) IDs of organization memberships to be added.

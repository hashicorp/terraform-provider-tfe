# tfe_registry_gpg_key

Manages a public key of the GPG key pair used to sign releases of private providers in the private registry.

The provided GPG key must be ASCII-armored, i.e. starting with:
"`-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n\n...`".

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.registry_gpg_key import RegistryGpgKey
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        RegistryGpgKey(self, "example",
            ascii_armor=Token.as_string(Fn.file("my-public-key.asc")),
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `ascii_armor` - (Required) ASCII-armored representation of the GPG key.
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.

## Attributes Reference

* `created_at` - The time when the GPG key was created.

Provides a project resource.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe_organization_test_organization = tfe.organization.Organization(self, "test-organization",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        tfe.project.Project(self, "test",
            name="projectname",
            organization=cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_organization_test_organization.name)
        )
```

With tags:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe_organization_test_organization = tfe.organization.Organization(self, "test-organization",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        tfe.project.Project(self, "test",
            name="projectname",
            organization=cdktf.Token.as_string(tfe_organization_test_organization.name),
            tags={
                "cost_center": "infrastructure",
                "team": "platform"
            }
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the project.
    *  TFE versions v202404-2 and earlier support between 3-36 characters
    *  TFE versions v202405-1 and later support between 3-40 characters
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `description` - (Optional) A description for the project.
* `auto_destroy_activity_duration` - A duration string for all workspaces in the project, representing time after each workspace's activity when an auto-destroy run will be triggered.
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of key-value tags to add to the project.
* `ignore_additional_tags` - (Optional) Explicitly ignores `tags`
_not_ defined by config so they will not be overwritten by the configured
tags. This creates exceptional behavior in Terraform with respect
to `tags` and is not recommended. This value must be applied before it
will be used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The project ID.

## Import

Projects can be imported; use `<PROJECT ID>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_project.test prj-niVoeESBXT8ZREhr
```

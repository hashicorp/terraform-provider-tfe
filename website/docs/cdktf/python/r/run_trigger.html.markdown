# tfe_run_trigger

Terraform Cloud provides a way to connect your workspace to one or more workspaces within your organization, 
known as "source workspaces". These connections, called run triggers, allow runs to queue automatically in 
your workspace on successful apply of runs in any of the source workspaces. You can connect your workspace 
to up to 20 source workspaces.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tfe.organization import Organization
from imports.tfe.run_trigger import RunTrigger
from imports.tfe.workspace import Workspace
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        test_organization = Organization(self, "test-organization",
            email="admin@company.com",
            name="my-org-name"
        )
        test_sourceable = Workspace(self, "test-sourceable",
            name="my-sourceable-workspace-name",
            organization=test_organization.id
        )
        test_workspace = Workspace(self, "test-workspace",
            name="my-workspace-name",
            organization=test_organization.id
        )
        RunTrigger(self, "test",
            sourceable_id=test_sourceable.id,
            workspace_id=test_workspace.id
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `workspace_id` - (Required) The id of the workspace that owns the run trigger. This is the 
  workspace where runs will be triggered.
* `sourceable_id` - (Required) The id of the sourceable. The sourceable must be a workspace.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the run trigger.

## Import

Run triggers can be imported; use `<RUN TRIGGER ID>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_run_trigger.test rt-qV9JnKRkmtMa4zcA
```

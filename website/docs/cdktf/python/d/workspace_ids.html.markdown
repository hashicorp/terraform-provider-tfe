# Data Source: tfe_workspace_ids

Use this data source to get a map of workspace IDs.

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.

from imports.tfe.data_tfe_workspace_ids import DataTfeWorkspaceIds
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        DataTfeWorkspaceIds(self, "all",
            names=["*"],
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
        DataTfeWorkspaceIds(self, "app-frontend",
            names=["app-frontend-prod", "app-frontend-dev1", "app-frontend-staging"],
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
        DataTfeWorkspaceIds(self, "prod-apps",
            organization="my-org-name",
            tag_names=["prod", "app", "aws"]
        )
        DataTfeWorkspaceIds(self, "prod-only",
            exclude_tags=["app"],
            organization="my-org-name",
            tag_names=["prod"]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported. At least one of `names` or `tag_names` must be present. Both can be used together.

* `names` - (Optional) A list of workspace names to search for. Names that don't
  match a valid workspace will be omitted from the results, but are not an error.

    To select _all_ workspaces for an organization, provide a list with a single
    asterisk, like `["*"]`. The asterisk also supports partial matching on prefix and/or suffix, like `[*-prod]`, `[test-*]`, `[*dev*]`.
* `tag_names` - (Optional) A list of tag names to search for.
* `exclude_tags` - (Optional) A list of tag names to exclude when searching.
* `organization` - (Required) Name of the organization.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `full_names` - A map of workspace names and their full names, which look like `<ORGANIZATION>/<WORKSPACE>`.
* `ids` - A map of workspace names and their opaque, immutable IDs, which look like `ws-<RANDOM STRING>`.

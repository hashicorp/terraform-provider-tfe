# Data Source: tfe_registry_providers

Use this data source to get information about public and private providers in the private registry.

## Example Usage

All providers:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe.data_tfe_registry_providers.DataTfeRegistryProviders(self, "all",
            organization="my-org-name"
        )
```

All private providers:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe.data_tfe_registry_providers.DataTfeRegistryProviders(self, "private",
            organization="my-org-name",
            registry_name="private"
        )
```

Providers with "hashicorp" in their namespace or name:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        tfe.data_tfe_registry_providers.DataTfeRegistryProviders(self, "hashicorp",
            organization="my-org-name",
            search="hashicorp"
        )
```

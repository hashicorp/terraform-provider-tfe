# Data Source: tfe_outputs

This data source is used to retrieve the state outputs for a given workspace.
It enables output values in one Terraform configuration to be used in another.

~> **NOTE:** The `values` attribute is preemptively marked [sensitive](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output) and is only populated after a run completes on the associated workspace. Use the `nonsensitive_values` attribute to access the subset of the outputs
that are known to be non-sensitive.

## Example Usage

Using the `tfe_outputs` data source, the outputs `foo` and `bar` can be used as seen below:

In the example below, assume we have outputs defined in a `my-org/my-workspace`:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.random as random
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: random.
        #     For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.
        data_tfe_outputs_foo = tfe.data_tfe_outputs.DataTfeOutputs(self, "foo",
            organization="my-org",
            workspace="my-workspace"
        )
        random.id.Id(self, "vpc_id",
            byte_length=8,
            keepers=[{
                "bar": data_tfe_outputs_foo.values.bar
            }
            ]
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `organization` - (Required) The name of the organization.
* `workspace` - (Required) The name of the workspace.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `values` - The current output values for the specified workspace.
* `nonsensitive_values` - The current non-sensitive output values for the specified workspace, this is a subset of all output values.

# Data Source: tfe_slug

This data source is used to represent configuration files on a local filesystem
intended to be uploaded to HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise, in lieu of those files being
sourced from a configured VCS provider.

A unique checksum is generated for the specified local directory, which allows
resources such as `tfe_policy_set` track the files and upload a new gzip compressed
tar file containing configuration files (a Terraform "slug") when those files change.

## Example Usage

Tracking a local directory to upload the Sentinel configuration and policies:

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.tfe as tfe
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_tfe_slug_test = tfe.data_tfe_slug.DataTfeSlug(self, "test",
            source_path="policies/my-policy-set"
        )
        tfe_policy_set_test = tfe.policy_set.PolicySet(self, "test_1",
            name="my-policy-set",
            organization="my-org-name",
            slug=cdktf.Token.as_string_map(data_tfe_slug_test)
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        tfe_policy_set_test.override_logical_id("test")
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `source_path` - (Required) The path to the directory where the files are located.

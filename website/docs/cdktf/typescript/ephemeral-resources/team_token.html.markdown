# Ephemeral: tfe_team_token

Generates an ephemeral team token for use during a Terraform run.

Ephemeral team tokens are only valid within the context of a single run, and
are not stored in Terraform state.

Ephemeral resources are provisioned during the plan phase of a run as well as
the apply phase.

If you need the team token to remain valid for long-lived use, consider using the
`tfe_team_token` managed resource instead.

~> **NOTE:** Ephemeral resources are a new feature and may evolve as we continue to explore their most effective uses. [Learn more](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.10.x/resources/ephemeral).

## Example Usage

### Generate a new team token:

This will invalidate any existing team token.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Team } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new Team(this, "example", {
      name: "my-team-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `teamId` - (Required) ID of the team.

The following arguments are optional:

* `expiredAt` - (Optional) The token's expiration date. The expiration date must be a date/time string in RFC3339 
format (e.g., "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"). If no expiration date is supplied, the expiration date will default to null and 
never expire.

This ephemeral resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:

* `token` - The generated token. This value is sensitive and will not be stored
  in state.

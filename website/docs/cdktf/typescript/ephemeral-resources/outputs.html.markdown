# Ephemeral: tfe_outputs

This ephemeral resource is used to retrieve the state outputs for a given workspace.
It enables output values in one Terraform configuration to be used in another.
The retrieved output values are guaranteed not to be written to state.

~> **NOTE:** Ephemeral resources are a new feature and may evolve as we continue to explore their most effective uses. [Learn more](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.10.x/resources/ephemeral).

---

~> **NOTE:** Regardless of the sensitivity of the output values as set in HCP
Terraform, the `values` and `nonsensitiveValues` attributes in this ephemeral
resource are both treated as sensitive.

## Example Usage

Using the `tfe_outputs` ephemeral resource, the outputs `vault_role_id` and `vault_secret_id` can be used to configure a vault provider instance as seen below:

In the example below, assume we have outputs defined in a `my-org/my-workspace`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { VaultProvider } from "./.gen/providers/vault/provider";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: vault.
    For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
    new VaultProvider(this, "vault", {
      auth_login: [
        {
          parameters: [
            {
              role_id: foo.values.vaultRoleId,
              secret_id: foo.values.vaultSecretId,
            },
          ],
          path: "auth/approle/login",
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `organization` - (Optional) The name of the organization. If omitted, the
  organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `workspace` - (Required) The name of the workspace.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `values` - The current output values for the specified workspace.
* `nonsensitiveValues` - The current non-sensitive output values for the specified workspace, this is a subset of all output values.

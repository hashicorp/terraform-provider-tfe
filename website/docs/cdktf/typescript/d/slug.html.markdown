# Data Source: tfe_slug

This data source is used to represent configuration files on a local filesystem
intended to be uploaded to HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise, in lieu of those files being
sourced from a configured VCS provider.

A unique checksum is generated for the specified local directory, which allows
resources such as `tfePolicySet` track the files and upload a new gzip compressed
tar file containing configuration files (a Terraform "slug") when those files change.

## Example Usage

Tracking a local directory to upload the Sentinel configuration and policies:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataTfeSlugTest = new tfe.dataTfeSlug.DataTfeSlug(this, "test", {
      sourcePath: "policies/my-policy-set",
    });
    const tfePolicySetTest = new tfe.policySet.PolicySet(this, "test_1", {
      name: "my-policy-set",
      organization: "my-org-name",
      slug: cdktf.Token.asStringMap(dataTfeSlugTest),
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfePolicySetTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `sourcePath` - (Required) The path to the directory where the files are located.

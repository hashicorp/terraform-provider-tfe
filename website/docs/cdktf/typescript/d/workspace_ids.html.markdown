# Data Source: tfe_workspace_ids

Use this data source to get a map of workspace IDs.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataTfeWorkspaceIds } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/data-tfe-workspace-ids";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataTfeWorkspaceIds(this, "all", {
      names: ["*"],
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    new DataTfeWorkspaceIds(this, "app-frontend", {
      names: ["app-frontend-prod", "app-frontend-dev1", "app-frontend-staging"],
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    new DataTfeWorkspaceIds(this, "dev_env_tags_only", {
      organization: "my-org-name",
      tagFilters: {
        include: {
          environment: "dev",
        },
      },
    });
    new DataTfeWorkspaceIds(this, "exclude_all_matching_key", {
      organization: "my-org-name",
      tagFilters: {
        exclude: {
          bad_key: "*",
        },
      },
    });
    new DataTfeWorkspaceIds(this, "include_and_exclude", {
      organization: "my-org-name",
      tagFilters: {
        exclude: {
          team: "prodsec",
        },
        include: {
          region: "us-east-1",
        },
      },
    });
    new DataTfeWorkspaceIds(this, "prod-apps", {
      organization: "my-org-name",
      tagNames: ["prod", "app", "aws"],
    });
    new DataTfeWorkspaceIds(this, "prod-only", {
      excludeTags: ["app"],
      organization: "my-org-name",
      tagNames: ["prod"],
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported. At least one of `names` or `tagNames` must be present. Both can be used together.

* `names` - (Optional) A list of workspace names to search for. Names that don't
  match a valid workspace will be omitted from the results, but are not an error.

    To select _all_ workspaces for an organization, provide a list with a single
    asterisk, like `["*"]`. The asterisk also supports partial matching on prefix and/or suffix, like `[*-prod]`, `[test-*]`, `[*dev*]`.
* `tagFilters` - (Optional) A set of key-value tag filters to search for workspaces.
* `tagNames` - (Optional) **Deprecated** A list of tag names to search for.
* `excludeTags` - (Optional) **Deprecated** A list of tag names to exclude when searching.
* `organization` - (Required) Name of the organization.

The `tagFilters` block supports:

* `include`: (Optional) A map of key-value tags the workspaces must contain. Each tag included here will be combined using a logical AND when filtering results.
* `exclude`: (Optional) A map of key-value tags to exclude workspaces from the returned list. To exclude all workspaces containing a specific key, use `"*"` as the value.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `fullNames` - A map of workspace names and their full names, which look like `<ORGANIZATION>/<WORKSPACE>`.
* `ids` - A map of workspace names and their opaque, immutable IDs, which look like `ws-<RANDOM STRING>`.

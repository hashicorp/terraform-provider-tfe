# Data Source: tfe_project

Use this data source to get information about a project.

~> **NOTE:** The `workspaceIds` and `workspaceNames` attributes are not guaranteed to return values in the same order, so they cannot be reliably mapped to one another. To map workspace names to IDs reliably, it is recommended to pass those names into the `tfe_workspace_ids` data source.

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataTfeProject } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/data-tfe-project";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataTfeProject(this, "foo", {
      name: "my-project-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
  }
}

```

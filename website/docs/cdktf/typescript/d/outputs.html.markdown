# Data Source: tfe_outputs

This data source is used to retrieve the state outputs for a given workspace.
It enables output values in one Terraform configuration to be used in another.

~> **NOTE:** The `values` attribute is preemptively marked [sensitive](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output) and is only populated after a run completes on the associated workspace. Use the `nonsensitiveValues` attribute to access the subset of the outputs
that are known to be non-sensitive.

## Example Usage

Using the `tfeOutputs` data source, the outputs `foo` and `bar` can be used as seen below:

In the example below, assume we have outputs defined in a `myOrg/myWorkspace`:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as random from "./.gen/providers/random";
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: random.
    For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
    const dataTfeOutputsFoo = new tfe.dataTfeOutputs.DataTfeOutputs(
      this,
      "foo",
      {
        organization: "my-org",
        workspace: "my-workspace",
      }
    );
    new random.id.Id(this, "vpc_id", {
      byte_length: 8,
      keepers: [
        {
          bar: dataTfeOutputsFoo.values.bar,
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

## Attributes Reference

# Data Source: tfe_outputs

This data source is used to retrieve the state outputs for a given workspace.
It enables output values in one Terraform configuration to be used in another.

~> **NOTE:** The `values` attribute is preemptively marked [sensitive](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output) and is only populated after a run completes on the associated workspace. Use the `nonsensitiveValues` attribute to access the subset of the outputs
that are known to be non-sensitive.

## Example Usage

Using the `tfeOutputs` data source, the outputs `foo` and `bar` can be used as seen below:

In the example below, assume we have outputs defined in a `myOrg/myWorkspace`:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Id } from "./.gen/providers/random/id";
import { DataTfeOutputs } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/data-tfe-outputs";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: random.
    For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
    const foo = new DataTfeOutputs(this, "foo", {
      organization: "my-org",
      workspace: "my-workspace",
    });
    new Id(this, "vpc_id", {
      byte_length: 8,
      keepers: [
        {
          bar: foo.values.bar,
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}

```

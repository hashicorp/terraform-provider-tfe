# Data Source: tfe_registry_provider

Use this data source to get information about a public or private provider in the private registry.

## Example Usage

A private provider:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new tfe.registryProvider.RegistryProvider(this, "example", {
      name: "my-provider",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
  }
}

```

A public provider:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new tfe.registryProvider.RegistryProvider(this, "example", {
      name: "aws",
      namespace: "hashicorp",
      organization: "my-org-name",
      registryName: "public",
    });
  }
}

```

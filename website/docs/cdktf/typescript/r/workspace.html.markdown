# tfe_workspace

Provides a workspace resource.

~> **NOTE:** Setting the execution mode and agent pool affinity directly on the workspace is deprecated in favor of using both [tfe_workspace_settings](workspace_settings) and [tfe_organization_default_settings](organization_default_settings), since they allow more precise control and fully support [agent_pool_allowed_workspaces](agent_pool_allowed_workspaces). Use caution when unsetting `executionMode`, as it now leaves any prior value unmanaged instead of reverting to the old default value of `"remote"`.

~> **NOTE:** Using `globalRemoteState` or `remoteStateConsumerIds` requires using the provider with HCP Terraform or an instance of Terraform Enterprise at least as recent as v202104-1.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Organization } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/organization";
import { Workspace } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/workspace";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const testOrganization = new Organization(this, "test-organization", {
      email: "admin@company.com",
      name: "my-org-name",
    });
    new Workspace(this, "test", {
      name: "my-workspace-name",
      organization: testOrganization.name,
      tagNames: ["test", "app"],
    });
  }
}

```

    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the workspace.
* `agentPoolId` - (Optional) **Deprecated** The ID of an agent pool to assign to the workspace. Use [tfe_workspace_settings](workspace_settings) instead.
* `allowDestroyPlan` - (Optional) Whether destroy plans can be queued on the workspace.
* `assessmentsEnabled` - (Optional) Whether to regularly run health assessments such as drift detection on the workspace. Defaults to `false`.
* `autoApply` - (Optional) Whether to automatically apply changes when a Terraform plan is successful. Defaults to `false`.
* `autoApplyRunTrigger` - (Optional) Whether to automatically apply changes for runs that were created by run triggers from another workspace. Defaults to `false`.
* `autoDestroyAt` - (Optional) A future date/time string at which point all resources in a workspace will be scheduled for deletion. Must be a string in RFC3339 format (e.g. "2100-01-01T00:00:00Z").

~> **NOTE:** `autoDestroyAt` is not intended for workspaces containing production resources or long-lived workspaces. Since this attribute is in-part managed by HCP Terraform, using `ignore_changes` for this attribute may be preferred.

* `description` - (Optional) A description for the workspace.
* `executionMode` - (Optional) **Deprecated** Which [execution mode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#execution-mode) to use. Use [tfe_workspace_settings](workspace_settings) instead.
* `fileTriggersEnabled` - (Optional) Whether to filter runs based on the changed files
  in a VCS push. Defaults to `true`. If enabled, the working directory and
  trigger prefixes describe a set of paths which must contain changes for a
  VCS push to trigger a run. If disabled, any push will trigger a run.
* `forceDelete` - (Optional) If this attribute is present on a workspace that is being deleted through the provider, it will use the existing force delete API. If this attribute is not present or false it will safe delete the workspace.
* `globalRemoteState` - (Optional) Whether the workspace allows all workspaces in the organization to access its state data during runs. If false, then only specifically approved workspaces can access its state (`remoteStateConsumerIds`).
* `operations` - **Deprecated** Whether to use remote execution mode.
  Defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, the workspace will be used for
  state storage only. This value _must not_ be provided if `executionMode` is
  provided.
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `projectId` - (Optional) ID of the project where the workspace should be created.
* `queueAllRuns` - (Optional) Whether the workspace should start
  automatically performing runs immediately after its creation. Defaults to
  `true`. When set to `false`, runs triggered by a webhook (such as a commit
  in VCS) will not be queued until at least one run has been manually queued.
  **Note:** This default differs from the HCP Terraform API default, which
  is `false`. The provider uses `true` as any workspace provisioned with
  `false` would need to then have a run manually queued out-of-band before
  accepting webhooks.
* `remoteStateConsumerIds` - (Optional) The set of workspace IDs set as explicit remote state consumers for the given workspace.
* `sourceName` - (Optional) A friendly name for the application or client
   creating this workspace. If set, this will be displayed on the workspace as
   "Created via <SOURCE NAME>".
   Requires `sourceUrl` to also be set.
* `sourceUrl` - (Optional) A URL for the application or client creating this
   workspace. This can be the URL of a related resource in another app, or a
   link to documentation or other info about the client.
   Requires `sourceName` to also be set.
   **Note:** The API does not (currently) allow this to be updated after a
   workspace has been created, so modifying this value will result in the
   workspace being replaced. To disable this, use an [ignore changes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#ignore_changes) lifecycle meta-argument
* `speculativeEnabled` - (Optional) Whether this workspace allows speculative
  plans. Defaults to `true`. Setting this to `false` prevents HCP Terraform
  or the Terraform Enterprise instance from running plans on pull requests,
  which can improve security if the VCS repository is public or includes
  untrusted contributors.
* `structuredRunOutputEnabled` - (Optional) Whether this workspace should
  show output from Terraform runs using the enhanced UI when available.
  Defaults to `true`. Setting this to `false` ensures that all runs in this
  workspace will display their output as text logs.
* `sshKeyId` - (Optional) The ID of an SSH key to assign to the workspace.
* `tagNames` - (Optional) A list of tag names for this workspace. Note that tags must only contain lowercase letters, numbers, colons, or hyphens.
* `ignoreAdditionalTagNames` - (Optional) Explicitly ignores `tagNames`
_not_ defined by config so they will not be overwritten by the configured
tags. This creates exceptional behavior in terraform with respect
to `tagNames` and is not recommended. This value must be applied before it
will be used.
* `terraformVersion` - (Optional) The version of Terraform to use for this
  workspace. This can be either an exact version or a
  [version constraint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints)
  (like `~> 1.0.0`); if you specify a constraint, the workspace will always use
  the newest release that meets that constraint. Defaults to the latest
  available version.
* `triggerPatterns` - (Optional) List of [glob patterns](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/vcs#glob-patterns-for-automatic-run-triggering) that describe the files HCP Terraform monitors for changes. Trigger patterns are always appended to the root directory of the repository. Mutually exclusive with `trigger-prefixes`.
* `triggerPrefixes` - (Optional) List of repository-root-relative paths which describe all locations
  to be tracked for changes.
* `vcsRepo` - (Optional) Settings for the workspace's VCS repository, enabling the [UI/VCS-driven run workflow](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/ui).
  Omit this argument to utilize the [CLI-driven](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/cli) and [API-driven](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/api)
  workflows, where runs are not driven by webhooks on your VCS provider.
* `workingDirectory` - (Optional) A relative path that Terraform will execute within.  Defaults to the root of your repository.

The `vcsRepo` block supports:

* `identifier` - (Required) A reference to your VCS repository in the format
  `<vcs organization>/<repository>` where `<vcs organization>` and `<repository>` refer to the organization and repository
  in your VCS provider. The format for Azure DevOps is `<ado organization>/<ado project>/_git/<ado repository>`.
* `branch` - (Optional) The repository branch that Terraform will execute from.
  This defaults to the repository's default branch (e.g. main).
* `githubAppInstallationId` - (Optional) The installation id of the Github App. This conflicts with `oauthTokenId` and can only be used if `oauthTokenId` is not used.
* `ingressSubmodules` - (Optional) Whether submodules should be fetched when
  cloning the VCS repository. Defaults to `false`.
* `oauthTokenId` - (Optional) The VCS Connection (OAuth Connection + Token) to use.
  This ID can be obtained from a `tfe_oauth_client` resource. This conflicts with `githubAppInstallationId` and can only be used if `githubAppInstallationId` is not used.
* `tagsRegex` - (Optional) A regular expression used to trigger a Workspace run for matching Git tags. This option conflicts with `triggerPatterns` and `triggerPrefixes`. Should only set this value if the former is not being used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The workspace ID.
* `resourceCount` - The number of resources managed by the workspace.
* `htmlUrl` - The URL to the browsable HTML overview of the workspace.

## Import

Workspaces can be imported; use `<WORKSPACE ID>` or `<ORGANIZATION NAME>/<WORKSPACE NAME>` as the
import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_workspace.test ws-CH5in3chf8RJjrVd
```

```shell
terraform import tfe_workspace.test my-org-name/my-wkspace-name
```

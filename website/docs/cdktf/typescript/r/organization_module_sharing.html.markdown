# tfe_organization_module_sharing

Manage module sharing for an organization. This resource requires the
use of an admin token and is for Terraform Enterprise only.

-> **NOTE:** `tfeOrganizationModuleSharing` is deprecated in favor of using `tfeAdminOrganizationSettings` which also allows the management of the global module sharing setting. They attempt to manage the same resource and are mutually exclusive.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new tfe.organizationModuleSharing.OrganizationModuleSharing(this, "test", {
      moduleConsumers: ["my-org-name-2", "my-org-name-3"],
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `moduleConsumers` - (Required) Names of the organizations to consume the module registry.

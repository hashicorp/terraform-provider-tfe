# tfe_organization_run_task

[Run tasks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks) allow HCP Terraform to interact with external systems at specific points in the HCP Terraform run lifecycle. Run tasks are reusable configurations that you can attach to any workspace in an organization.

The tfe_organization_run_task resource creates, updates and destroys [Organization Run tasks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/run-tasks#creating-a-run-task).

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new tfe.organizationRunTask.OrganizationRunTask(this, "example", {
      description: "An example task",
      enabled: true,
      name: "task-name",
      organization: "org-name",
      url: "https://external.service.com",
    });
  }
}

```

```
-> **Note:** Write-Only argument `hmacKeyWo` is available to use in place of `hmacKey`. Write-Only arguments are supported in HashiCorp Terraform 1.11.0 and later. [Learn more](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.11.x/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments).

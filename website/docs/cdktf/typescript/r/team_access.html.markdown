# tfe_team_access

Associate a team to permissions on a workspace.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const tfeTeamTest = new tfe.team.Team(this, "test", {
      name: "my-team-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const tfeWorkspaceTest = new tfe.workspace.Workspace(this, "test_1", {
      name: "my-workspace-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeWorkspaceTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
    const tfeTeamAccessTest = new tfe.teamAccess.TeamAccess(this, "test_2", {
      access: "read",
      teamId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeTeamTest.id),
      workspaceId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeWorkspaceTest.id),
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamAccessTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `teamId` - (Required) ID of the team to add to the workspace.
* `workspaceId` - (Required) ID of the workspace to which the team will be added.
* `access` - (Optional) Type of fixed access to grant. Valid values are `admin`, `read`, `plan`, or `write`. To use `custom` permissions, use a `permissions` block instead. This value _must not_ be provided if `permissions` is provided.
* `permissions` - (Optional) Permissions to grant using [custom workspace permissions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#custom-workspace-permissions). This value _must not_ be provided if `access` is provided.

The `permissions` block supports:

* `runs` - (Required) The permission to grant the team on the workspace's runs. Valid values are `read`, `plan`, or `apply`.
* `variables` - (Required) The permission to grant the team on the workspace's variables. Valid values are `none`, `read`, or `write`.
* `stateVersions` - (Required) The permission to grant the team on the workspace's state versions. Valid values are `none`, `read`, `readOutputs`, or `write`.
* `sentinelMocks` - (Required) The permission to grant the team on the workspace's generated Sentinel mocks, Valid values are `none` or `read`.
* `workspaceLocking` - (Required) Boolean determining whether or not to grant the team permission to manually lock/unlock the workspace.
* `runTasks` - (Required) Boolean determining whether or not to grant the team permission to manage workspace run tasks.

-> **Note:** At least one of `access` or `permissions` _must_ be provided, but not both. Whichever is omitted will automatically reflect the state of the other.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` The team access ID.

## Import

Team accesses can be imported; use
`<ORGANIZATION NAME>/<WORKSPACE NAME>/<TEAM ACCESS ID>` as the import ID. For
example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_team_access.test my-org-name/my-workspace-name/tws-8S5wnRbRpogw6apb
```

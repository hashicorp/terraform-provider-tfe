# tfe_sentinel_policy

Sentinel Policy as Code is an embedded policy as code framework integrated
with Terraform Enterprise.

Policies are configured on a per-organization level and are organized and
grouped into policy sets, which define the workspaces on which policies are
enforced during runs.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { SentinelPolicy } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/sentinel-policy";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new SentinelPolicy(this, "test", {
      description: "This policy always passes",
      enforceMode: "hard-mandatory",
      name: "my-policy-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
      policy: "main = rule { true }",
    });
  }
}

```

# tfe_team_organization_member

Add or remove a team member using a
[tfe_organization_membership](organization_membership.html).

~> **NOTE** on managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides four
resources for managing team memberships. This - along with [tfe_organization_membership](organization_membership.html) - is the preferred method as it
allows you to add members to a team by email addresses. The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) is used to manage a single team membership whereas [tfe_team_organization_members](team_organization_members.html) is used to manage all team memberships at once. All four resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

~> **NOTE:** This resource requires using the provider with Terraform Cloud or
an instance of Terraform Enterprise at least as recent as v202004-1.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { OrganizationMembership } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/organization-membership";
import { Team } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team";
import { TeamOrganizationMember } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team-organization-member";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const test = new OrganizationMembership(this, "test", {
      email: "example@hashicorp.com",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const tfeTeamTest = new Team(this, "test_1", {
      name: "my-team-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
    const tfeTeamOrganizationMemberTest = new TeamOrganizationMember(
      this,
      "test_2",
      {
        organizationMembershipId: test.id,
        teamId: Token.asString(tfeTeamTest.id),
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamOrganizationMemberTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `teamId` - (Required) ID of the team.
* `organizationMembershipId` - (Required) ID of the organization membership.

## Import

A team member can be imported; use `<TEAM ID>/<ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP ID>` or `<ORGANIZATION NAME>/<USER EMAIL>/<TEAM NAME>`
as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_team_organization_member.test team-47qC3LmA47piVan7/ou-2342390sdf0jj
```
or
```shell
terraform import tfe_team_organization_member.test my-org-name/user@company.com/my-team-name
```
~> **NOTE:** The `<ORGANIZATION NAME>/<USER EMAIL>/<TEAM NAME>` import ID format cannot be used if there are `/` characters in the user's email. These users must be imported with the `<TEAM ID>/<ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP ID>` format instead

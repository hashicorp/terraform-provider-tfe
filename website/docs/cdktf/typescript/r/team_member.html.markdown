# tfe_team_member

Add or remove a user from a team.

~> **NOTE** on managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides four
resources for managing team memberships.
The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) and [tfe_team_organization_members](team_organization_members.html) resources are
the preferred way. The [tfe_team_member](team_member.html)
resource can be used multiple times as it manages the team membership for a
single user.  The [tfe_team_members](team_members.html) resource, on the other
hand, is used to manage all team memberships for a specific team and can only be
used once. All four resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const tfeTeamTest = new tfe.team.Team(this, "test", {
      name: "my-team-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const tfeTeamMemberTest = new tfe.teamMember.TeamMember(this, "test_1", {
      teamId: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeTeamTest.id),
      username: "sander",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamMemberTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `teamId` - (Required) ID of the team.
* `username` - (Required) Name of the user to add.

## Import

A team member can be imported; use `<TEAM ID>/<USERNAME>` as the import ID. For
example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_team_member.test team-47qC3LmA47piVan7/sander
```

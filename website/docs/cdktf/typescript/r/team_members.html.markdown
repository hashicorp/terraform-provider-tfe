# tfe_team_members

Manages users in a team.

~> **NOTE** on managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides four
resources for managing team memberships.
The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) and [tfe_team_organization_members](team_organization_members.html) resources are
the preferred way. The [tfe_team_member](team_member.html)
resource can be used multiple times as it manages the team membership for a
single user.  The [tfe_team_members](team_members.html) resource, on the other
hand, is used to manage all team memberships for a specific team and can only be
used once. All four resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Team } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team";
import { TeamMembers } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team-members";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const test = new Team(this, "test", {
      name: "my-team-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const tfeTeamMembersTest = new TeamMembers(this, "test_1", {
      teamId: test.id,
      usernames: ["admin", "sander"],
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamMembersTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

With a set of usernames:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Team } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team";
import { TeamMembers } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team-members";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const allUsernames = Fn.toset(["user1", "user2"]);
    const test = new Team(this, "test", {
      name: "my-team-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const tfeTeamMembersTest = new TeamMembers(this, "test_1", {
      teamId: test.id,
      usernames: Token.asList(
        "${[ for user in ${" + allUsernames + "} : user]}"
      ),
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamMembersTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

# tfe_team_organization_members

Add or remove one or more team members using a
[tfe_organization_membership](organization_membership.html).

~> **NOTE** on managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides four
resources for managing team memberships. This - along with [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) - is the preferred method as it
allows you to add members to a team by email addresses. The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) is used to manage a single team membership whereas [tfe_team_organization_members](team_organization_members.html) is used to manage all team memberships at once. All four resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

~> **NOTE:** This resource requires using the provider with HCP Terraform or
an instance of Terraform Enterprise at least as recent as v202004-1.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { OrganizationMembership } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/organization-membership";
import { Team } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team";
import { TeamOrganizationMembers } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team-organization-members";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const sample = new OrganizationMembership(this, "sample", {
      email: "sample@hashicorp.com",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const test = new OrganizationMembership(this, "test", {
      email: "example@hashicorp.com",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const tfeTeamTest = new Team(this, "test_2", {
      name: "my-team-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
    const tfeTeamOrganizationMembersTest = new TeamOrganizationMembers(
      this,
      "test_3",
      {
        organizationMembershipIds: [test.id, sample.id],
        teamId: Token.asString(tfeTeamTest.id),
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamOrganizationMembersTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

With a set of organization members:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformIterator, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { OrganizationMembership } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/organization-membership";
import { Team } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team";
import { TeamOrganizationMembers } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/team-organization-members";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const allUsers = Fn.toset(["user1@hashicorp.com", "user2@hashicorp.com"]);
    /*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
    not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
    you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
    you need to keep this like it is.*/
    const allMembershipForEachIterator = TerraformIterator.fromList(
      Token.asAny(allUsers)
    );
    new OrganizationMembership(this, "all_membership", {
      email: Token.asString(allMembershipForEachIterator.key),
      organization: "my-org-name",
      forEach: allMembershipForEachIterator,
    });
    const test = new Team(this, "test", {
      name: "my-team-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
    const tfeTeamOrganizationMembersTest = new TeamOrganizationMembers(
      this,
      "test_2",
      {
        organizationMembershipIds: Token.asList(
          "${[ for member in ${" +
            allUsers +
            "} : tfe_organization_membership.all_membership[member].id]}"
        ),
        teamId: test.id,
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    tfeTeamOrganizationMembersTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
  }
}

```

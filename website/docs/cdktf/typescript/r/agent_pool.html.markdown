# tfe_agent_pool

An agent pool represents a group of agents, often related to one another by sharing a common
network segment or purpose. A workspace may be configured to use one of the organization's agent
pools to run remote operations with isolated, private, or on-premises infrastructure.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const tfeOrganizationTestOrganization = new tfe.organization.Organization(
      this,
      "test-organization",
      {
        email: "admin@company.com",
        name: "my-org-name",
      }
    );
    new tfe.agentPool.AgentPool(this, "test-agent-pool", {
      name: "my-agent-pool-name",
      organization: cdktf.Token.asString(tfeOrganizationTestOrganization.name),
      organizationScoped: true,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of the agent pool.
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `organizationScoped` - (Optional) Whether or not the agent pool is scoped to all workspaces in the organization. Defaults to `true`.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the agent pool.
* `name` - The name of agent pool.
* `organization` - The name of the organization associated with the agent pool.

## Import

Agent pools can be imported; use `<AGENT POOL ID>` or `<ORGANIZATION NAME>/<AGENT POOL NAME>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_agent_pool.test apool-rW0KoLSlnuNb5adB
```

```shell
terraform import tfe_workspace.test my-org-name/my-agent-pool-name
```

# tfe_project_settings

**Requires Terraform CLI version 1.0 and later**

Use this resource to manage Project Settings.

Primarily, this resource allows setting default execution mode and agent pool for all workspaces within a project. When not specified, the organization defaults will be used.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { AgentPool } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/agent-pool";
import { Organization } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/organization";
import { Project } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/project";
import { ProjectSettings } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/project-settings";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const test = new Organization(this, "test", {
      default_execution_mode: "remote",
      email: "admin@company.com",
      name: "my-org-name",
    });
    const myProject = new Project(this, "my_project", {
      name: "my-project",
      organization: test.name,
    });
    const myAgents = new AgentPool(this, "my_agents", {
      name: "my-agent-pool",
      organization: test.name,
    });
    new ProjectSettings(this, "my_project_settings", {
      defaultAgentPoolId: myAgents.id,
      defaultExecutionMode: "agent",
      projectId: myProject.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
* `projectId` - (Required) The ID of the project to manage settings for.
* `defaultExecutionMode` - (Optional) Which [execution mode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings#execution-mode)
  to use as the default for all workspaces in the project. Valid values are `remote`, `local` or `agent`.
* `defaultAgentPoolId` - (Optional) The ID of an agent pool to assign to the workspace. Requires `defaultExecutionMode` to be set to `agent`. This value _must not_ be provided if `defaultExecutionMode` is set to any other value.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:
* `overwrites` - Can be used to check whether a setting is currently inheriting its value from the organization.
  - `defaultExecutionMode` - Set to `true` if the default execution mode of the project is being determined by the setting on the project itself. It will be `false` if the execution mode is inherited from another resource (e.g. the organization's default execution mode)
  - `defaultAgentPoolId` - Set to `true` if the default agent pool of the project is being determined by the setting on the project itself. It will be `false` if the agent pool is inherited from another resource (e.g. the organization's default agent pool)parent project.

## Import

Project settings  can be imported; use the `<PROJECT_ID>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_project_settings.my_project_settings <PROJECT_ID>
```

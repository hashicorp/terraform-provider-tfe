# tfe_agent_pool_allowed_workspaces

Adds and removes allowed workspaces on an agent pool.

~> **NOTE:** This resource requires using the provider with HCP Terraform and a HCP Terraform
for Business account.
[Learn more about HCP Terraform pricing here](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/pricing).

## Example Usage

In this example, the agent pool and workspace are connected through other resources that manage the agent pool permissions as well as the workspace execution mode. Notice that the `tfe_workspace_settings` uses the agent pool reference found in `tfe_agent_pool_allowed_workspaces` in order to create the permission to use the agent pool before assigning it.

import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*

import { AgentPool } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/agent-pool";
import { AgentPoolAllowedWorkspaces } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/agent-pool-allowed-workspaces";
import { Organization } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/organization";
import { Workspace } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/workspace";
import { WorkspaceSettings } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/workspace-settings";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const testOrganization = new Organization(this, "test-organization", {
      email: "admin@company.com",
      name: "my-org-name",
    });
    const testWorkspace = new Workspace(this, "test-workspace", {
      name: "my-workspace-name",
      organization: testOrganization.name,
    });
    const testAgentPool = new AgentPool(this, "test-agent-pool", {
      name: "my-agent-pool-name",
      organization: testOrganization.name,
      organizationScoped: false,
    });
    const allowed = new AgentPoolAllowedWorkspaces(this, "allowed", {
      agentPoolId: testAgentPool.id,
      allowedWorkspaceIds: Token.asList(
        "${[ for key, value in ${" +
          Fn.lookupNested(test, ["*", "id"]) +
          "} : value]}"
      ),
    });
    new WorkspaceSettings(this, "test-workspace-settings", {
      agentPoolId: allowed.id,
      executionMode: "agent",
      workspaceId: testWorkspace.id,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `agentPoolId` - (Required) The ID of the agent pool.

# tfe_registry_gpg_key

"`-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n\n...`".

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, Token, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { RegistryGpgKey } from "./.gen/providers/tfe/registry-gpg-key";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new RegistryGpgKey(this, "example", {
      asciiArmor: Token.asString(Fn.file("my-public-key.asc")),
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `asciiArmor` - (Required) ASCII-armored representation of the GPG key.

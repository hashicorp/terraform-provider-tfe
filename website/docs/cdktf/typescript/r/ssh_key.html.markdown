# tfe_ssh_key

This resource represents an SSH key which includes a name and the SSH private
key. An organization can have multiple SSH keys available.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new tfe.sshKey.SshKey(this, "test", {
      key: "private-ssh-key",
      name: "my-ssh-key-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name to identify the SSH key.
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `key` - (Required) The text of the SSH private key.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` The ID of the SSH key.

## Import

Because the Terraform Enterprise API does not return the private SSH key
content, this resource cannot be imported.

# tfe_ssh_key

This resource represents an SSH key which includes a name and the SSH private
key. An organization can have multiple SSH keys available.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as tfe from "./.gen/providers/tfe";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new tfe.sshKey.SshKey(this, "test", {
      key: "private-ssh-key",
      name: "my-ssh-key-name",
      organization: "my-org-name",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name to identify the SSH key.
* `organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `key` - (Optional) The text of the SSH private key. One of `key` or `keyWo`
  must be provided.
* `keyWo` - (Optional, [Write-Only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.11.x/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The text of the SSH private key, guaranteed not to be
  written to plan or state artifacts. One of `key` or `keyWo` must be provided.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` The ID of the SSH key.

## Import

Because the Terraform Enterprise API does not return the private SSH key
content, this resource cannot be imported.

-> **Note:** Write-Only argument `keyWo` is available to use in place of `key`. Write-Only arguments are supported in HashiCorp Terraform 1.11.0 and later. [Learn more](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.11.x/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments).

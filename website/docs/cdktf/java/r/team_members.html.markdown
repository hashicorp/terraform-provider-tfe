# tfe_team_members

Manages users in a team.

~> **NOTE** on managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides four
resources for managing team memberships.
The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) and [tfe_team_organization_members](team_organization_members.html) resources are
the preferred way. The [tfe_team_member](team_member.html)
resource can be used multiple times as it manages the team membership for a
single user.  The [tfe_team_members](team_members.html) resource, on the other
hand, is used to manage all team memberships for a specific team and can only be
used once. All four resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```java
import software.constructs.*;
import com.hashicorp.cdktf.*;
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import gen.providers.tfe.team.*;
import gen.providers.tfe.teamMembers.*;
public class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
    public MyConvertedCode(Construct scope, String name) {
        super(scope, name);
        Team tfeTeamTest = new Team(this, "test", new TeamConfig()
                .name("my-team-name")
                .organization("my-org-name")
                );
        TeamMembers tfeTeamMembersTest = new TeamMembers(this, "test_1", new TeamMembersConfig()
                .teamId(Token.asString(tfeTeamTest.getId()))
                .usernames(List.of("admin", "sander"))
                );
        /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
        tfeTeamMembersTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
    }
}
```

With a set of usernames:

```java
import software.constructs.*;
import com.hashicorp.cdktf.*;
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import gen.providers.tfe.team.*;
import gen.providers.tfe.teamMembers.*;
public class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
    public MyConvertedCode(Construct scope, String name) {
        super(scope, name);
        String[] allUsernames = Fn.toset(List.of("user1", "user2"));
        Team tfeTeamTest = new Team(this, "test", new TeamConfig()
                .name("my-team-name")
                .organization("my-org-name")
                );
        TeamMembers tfeTeamMembersTest = new TeamMembers(this, "test_1", new TeamMembersConfig()
                .teamId(Token.asString(tfeTeamTest.getId()))
                .usernames(Token.asList("${[ for user in ${" + allUsernames + "} : user]}"))
                );
        /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
        tfeTeamMembersTest.overrideLogicalId("test");
    }
}
```

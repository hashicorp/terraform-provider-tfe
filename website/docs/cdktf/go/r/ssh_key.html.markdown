# tfe_ssh_key

This resource represents an SSH key which includes a name and the SSH private
key. An organization can have multiple SSH keys available.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```go
import constructs "github.com/aws/constructs-go/constructs"
import cdktf "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk-go/cdktf"
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import "github.com/aws-samples/dummy/gen/providers/tfe/sshKey"
type myConvertedCode struct {
	terraformStack
}

func newMyConvertedCode(scope construct, name *string) *myConvertedCode {
	this := &myConvertedCode{}
	cdktf.NewTerraformStack_Override(this, scope, name)
	sshKey.NewSshKey(this, jsii.String("test"), &sshKeyConfig{
		key: jsii.String("private-ssh-key"),
		name: jsii.String("my-ssh-key-name"),
		organization: jsii.String("my-org-name"),
	})
	return this
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `Name` - (Required) Name to identify the SSH key.
* `Organization` - (Optional) Name of the organization. If omitted, organization must be defined in the provider config.
* `Key` - (Optional) The text of the SSH private key. One of `Key` or `KeyWo`
  must be provided.
* `KeyWo` - (Optional, [Write-Only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.11.x/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The text of the SSH private key, guaranteed not to be
  written to plan or state artifacts. One of `Key` or `KeyWo` must be provided.

## Attributes Reference

* `Id` The ID of the SSH key.

## Import

Because the Terraform Enterprise API does not return the private SSH key
content, this resource cannot be imported.

-> **Note:** Write-Only argument `KeyWo` is available to use in place of `Key`. Write-Only arguments are supported in HashiCorp Terraform 1.11.0 and later. [Learn more](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.11.x/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments).

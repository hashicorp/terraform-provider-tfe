# tfe_team_organization_member

Add or remove a team member using a
[tfe_organization_membership](organization_membership.html).

~> **NOTE** on managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides four
resources for managing team memberships. This - along with [tfe_organization_membership](organization_membership.html) - is the preferred method as it
allows you to add members to a team by email addresses. The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) is used to manage a single team membership whereas [tfe_team_organization_members](team_organization_members.html) is used to manage all team memberships at once. All four resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

~> **NOTE:** This resource requires using the provider with Terraform Cloud or
an instance of Terraform Enterprise at least as recent as v202004-1.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```go
import constructs "github.com/aws/constructs-go/constructs"
import "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk-go/cdktf"
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import "github.com/aws-samples/dummy/gen/providers/tfe/organizationMembership"
import "github.com/aws-samples/dummy/gen/providers/tfe/team"
import "github.com/aws-samples/dummy/gen/providers/tfe/teamOrganizationMember"
type myConvertedCode struct {
	terraformStack
}

func newMyConvertedCode(scope construct, name *string) *myConvertedCode {
	this := &myConvertedCode{}
	cdktf.NewTerraformStack_Override(this, scope, name)
	tfeOrganizationMembershipTest :=
	organizationMembership.NewOrganizationMembership(this, jsii.String("test"), &organizationMembershipConfig{
		email: jsii.String("example@hashicorp.com"),
		organization: jsii.String("my-org-name"),
	})
	tfeTeamTest := team.NewTeam(this, jsii.String("test_1"), &teamConfig{
		name: jsii.String("my-team-name"),
		organization: jsii.String("my-org-name"),
	})
	/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
	tfeTeamTest.OverrideLogicalId(jsii.String("test"))
	tfeTeamOrganizationMemberTest :=
	teamOrganizationMember.NewTeamOrganizationMember(this, jsii.String("test_2"), &teamOrganizationMemberConfig{
		organizationMembershipId: cdktf.Token_AsString(tfeOrganizationMembershipTest.id),
		teamId: cdktf.Token_*AsString(tfeTeamTest.id),
	})
	/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
	tfeTeamOrganizationMemberTest.OverrideLogicalId(jsii.String("test"))
	return this
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `TeamId` - (Required) ID of the team.
* `OrganizationMembershipId` - (Required) ID of the organization membership.

## Import

A team member can be imported; use `<TEAM ID>/<ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP ID>` or `<ORGANIZATION NAME>/<USER EMAIL>/<TEAM NAME>`
as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_team_organization_member.test team-47qC3LmA47piVan7/ou-2342390sdf0jj
```
or
```shell
terraform import tfe_team_organization_member.test my-org-name/user@company.com/my-team-name
```
~> **NOTE:** The `<ORGANIZATION NAME>/<USER EMAIL>/<TEAM NAME>` import ID format cannot be used if there are `/` characters in the user's email. These users must be imported with the `<TEAM ID>/<ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP ID>` format instead

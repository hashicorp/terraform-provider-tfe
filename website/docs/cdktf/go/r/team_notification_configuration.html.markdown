# tfe_team_notification_configuration

HCP Terraform can be configured to send notifications to a team for certain events.
Team notification configurations allow you to specify a URL, destination type, and what events will trigger the notification.
Each team can have up to 20 notification configurations, and they apply to configured events for all workspaces that the configured team has access to.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```hcl
resource "tfe_organization" "test" {
  name  = "my-org-name"
  email = "admin@company.com"
}

resource "tfe_team" "test" {
  name         = "my-team-name"
  organization = tfe_organization.test.id
}

resource "tfe_team_notification_configuration" "test" {
  name             = "my-test-notification-configuration"
  enabled          = true
  destination_type = "generic"
  triggers         = ["change_request:created"]
  url              = "https://example.com"
  team_id          = tfe_team.test.id
}
```

With `DestinationType` of `Email`:

```hcl
resource "tfe_organization" "test" {
  name  = "my-org-name"
  email = "admin@company.com"
}

resource "tfe_team" "test" {
  name         = "my-team-name"
  organization = tfe_organization.test.id
}

data "tfe_organization_membership" "test" {
  organization = tfe_organization.test.name
  email        = "example@example.com"
}

resource "tfe_team_organization_member" "test" {
  team_id                    = tfe_team.test.id
  organization_membership_id = data.tfe_organization_membership.test.id
}

resource "tfe_team_notification_configuration" "test" {
  name             = "my-test-email-notification-configuration"
  enabled          = true
  destination_type = "email"
  email_user_ids   = [tfe_organization_membership.test.user_id]
  triggers         = ["change_request:created"]
  team_id          = tfe_team.test.id
}
```

(**TFE only**) With `DestinationType` of `Email`, using `EmailAddresses` list and `EmailUsers`:

```hcl
resource "tfe_organization" "test" {
  name  = "my-org-name"
  email = "admin@company.com"
}

resource "tfe_team" "test" {
  name         = "my-team-name"
  organization = tfe_organization.test.id
}

data "tfe_organization_membership" "test" {
  organization = tfe_organization.test.name
  email        = "example@example.com"
}

resource "tfe_team_organization_member" "test" {
  team_id                    = tfe_team.test.id
  organization_membership_id = data.tfe_organization_membership.test.id
}

resource "tfe_team_notification_configuration" "test" {
  name             = "my-test-email-notification-configuration"
  enabled          = true
  destination_type = "email"
  email_user_ids   = [tfe_organization_membership.test.user_id]
  email_addresses  = ["user1@company.com", "user2@company.com", "user3@company.com"]
  triggers         = ["change_request:created"]
  team_id          = tfe_team.test.id
}
```

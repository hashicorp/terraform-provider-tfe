# tfe_team_member

Add or remove a user from a team.

~> **NOTE** on managing team memberships: Terraform currently provides four
resources for managing team memberships.
The [tfe_team_organization_member](team_organization_member.html) and [tfe_team_organization_members](team_organization_members.html) resources are
the preferred way. The [tfe_team_member](team_member.html)
resource can be used multiple times as it manages the team membership for a
single user.  The [tfe_team_members](team_members.html) resource, on the other
hand, is used to manage all team memberships for a specific team and can only be
used once. All four resources cannot be used for the same team simultaneously.

## Example Usage

Basic usage:

```go
import constructs "github.com/aws/constructs-go/constructs"
import "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-cdk-go/cdktf"
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import "github.com/aws-samples/dummy/gen/providers/tfe/team"
import "github.com/aws-samples/dummy/gen/providers/tfe/teamMember"
type myConvertedCode struct {
	TerraformStack
}

func newMyConvertedCode(scope Construct, name *string) *myConvertedCode {
	this := &myConvertedCode{}
	cdktf.NewTerraformStack_Override(this, scope, name)
	tfeTeamTest := team.NewTeam(this, jsii.String("test"), &TeamConfig{
		name: jsii.String("my-team-name"),
		organization: jsii.String("my-org-name"),
	})
	tfeTeamMemberTest := teamMember.NewTeamMember(this, jsii.String("test_1"), &TeamMemberConfig{
		teamId: cdktf.Token_AsString(tfeTeamTest.id),
		username: jsii.String("sander"),
	})
	/*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
	tfeTeamMemberTest.OverrideLogicalId(jsii.String("test"))
	return this
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `TeamId` - (Required) ID of the team.
* `Username` - (Required) Name of the user to add.

## Import

A team member can be imported using an identity. For example:

```hcl
import {
  to = tfe_team_member.test
  identity = {
    id       = "team-6p5jTwJQXwqZBncC/my_user_name"
    hostname = "app.terraform.io"
  }
}
```

A team member can be imported; use `<TEAM ID>/<USERNAME>` as the import ID. For
example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_team_member.test team-47qC3LmA47piVan7/sander
```

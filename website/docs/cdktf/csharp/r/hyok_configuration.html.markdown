using Gen.Providers.Tfe;
class MyConvertedCode : TerraformStack
{
    public MyConvertedCode(Construct scope, string name) : base(scope, name)
    {
        var tfeGcpOidcConfigurationGcp =
        new GcpOidcConfiguration.GcpOidcConfiguration(this, "gcp", new GcpOidcConfigurationConfig {
            Organization = "my-org-name",
            ProjectNumber = "11111111",
            ServiceAccountEmail = "myemail@gmail.com",
            WorkloadProviderName = "projects/1/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/1/providers/1"
        });
        new HyokConfiguration.HyokConfiguration(this, "example", new HyokConfigurationConfig {
            AgentPoolId = "apool-MFtsuFxHkC9pCRgB",
            KekId = "key1",
            KmsOptions = new [] { new Struct {
                KeyLocation = "global",
                KeyRingId = "example-key-ring"
            } },
            Name = "my-key-name",
            OidcConfigurationId = Token.AsString(tfeGcpOidcConfigurationGcp.Id),
            OidcConfigurationType = "gcp",

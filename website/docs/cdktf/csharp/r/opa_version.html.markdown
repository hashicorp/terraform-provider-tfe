# tfe_opa_version

Manage OPA versions available on Terraform Enterprise.

## Example Usage

Basic Usage:

```csharp
using Constructs;
using HashiCorp.Cdktf;
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
using Gen.Providers.Tfe;
class MyConvertedCode : TerraformStack
{
    public MyConvertedCode(Construct scope, string name) : base(scope, name)
    {
        new OpaVersion.OpaVersion(this, "test", new OpaVersionConfig {
            Sha = "e75ac73deb69a6b3aa667cb0b8b731aee79e2904",
            Url = "https://tfe-host.com/path/to/opa",
            Version = "0.58.0-custom"
        });
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `Version` - (Required) A semantic version string in N.N.N or N.N.N-bundleName format.
* `Url` - (Soon to be deprecated) The URL where a 64-bit Linux binary of this version can be downloaded.
* `Sha` - (Soon to be deprecated) The SHA-256 checksum of the compressed OPA binary.
* `Official` - (Optional) Whether or not this is an official release of OPA. Defaults to "false".
* `Enabled` - (Optional) Whether or not this version of OPA is enabled for use in HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise. Defaults to "true".
* `Beta` - (Optional) Whether or not this version of OPA is beta pre-release. Defaults to "false".
* `Deprecated` - (Optional) Whether or not this version of OPA is deprecated. Defaults to "false".
* `DeprecatedReason` - (Optional) Additional context about why a version of OPA is deprecated. Defaults to "null" unless `Deprecated` is true.
* `Archs` - (Optional) A list of architecture-specific binaries for this Terraform version. Each entry in the list is a map containing the following attributes:
    * `Url` - (Required) The URL where a ZIP-compressed binary of this version can be downloaded.
    * `Sha` - (Required) The SHA-256 checksum of the compressed binary.
    * `Os` - (Required) The operating system for which this binary is intended.
    * `Arch` - (Required) The architecture for which this binary is intended.

    When specifying architecture-specific binaries, the top-level `Url` and `Sha` attributes are deprecated and should not be used. If both top-level `Url` and `Sha` are specified, an `Archs` entry for the `Amd64` architecture must also be included, and its `Url` and `Sha` values must match the top-level values.

## Attributes Reference

* `Id` The ID of the OPA version

## Import

OPA versions can be imported; use `<OPA VERSION ID>` or `<OPA VERSION NUMBER>` as the import ID. For example:

```shell
terraform import tfe_opa_version.test tool-L4oe7rNwn7J4E5Yr
```

```shell
terraform import tfe_opa_version.test 0.58.0
```

-> **Note:** You can fetch a OPA version ID from the URL of an existing version in the HCP Terraform UI. The ID is in the format `tool-<RANDOM STRING>`

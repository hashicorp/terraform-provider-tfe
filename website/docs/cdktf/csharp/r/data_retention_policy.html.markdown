# tfe_data_retention_policy

Creates a data retention policy attached to either an organization or workspace. This resource is for Terraform Enterprise only.

## Example Usage

Creating a data retention policy for a workspace:

```hcl
resource "tfe_organization" "test-organization" {
  name  = "my-org-name"
  email = "admin@company.com"
}

resource "tfe_workspace" "test-workspace" {
  name         = "my-workspace-name"
  organization = tfe_organization.test-organization.name
}

resource "tfe_data_retention_policy" "foobar" {
  workspace_id = tfe_workspace.test-workspace.id

  delete_older_than {
    days = 42
  }
}
```

Creating a data retention policy for an organization:

```csharp
using Constructs;
using HashiCorp.Cdktf;
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
using Gen.Providers.Tfe;
class MyConvertedCode : TerraformStack
{
    public MyConvertedCode(Construct scope, string name) : base(scope, name)
    {
        var tfeOrganizationTestOrganization = new Organization.Organization(this, "test-organization", new OrganizationConfig {
            Email = "admin@company.com",
            Name = "my-org-name"
        });
        new DataRetentionPolicy.DataRetentionPolicy(this, "foobar", new Struct {
            DeleteOlderThan = new [] { new Struct {
                Days = 1138
            } },
            Organization = Token.AsString(tfeOrganizationTestOrganization.Name)
        });
    }
}
```

Creating a data retention policy for an organization and exclude a single workspace from it:

```hcl
resource "tfe_organization" "test-organization" {
  name  = "my-org-name"
  email = "admin@company.com"
}

// create data retention policy the organization
resource "tfe_data_retention_policy" "foobar" {
  organization = tfe_organization.test-organization.name

  delete_older_than {
    days = 1138
  }
}

resource "tfe_workspace" "test-workspace" {
  name         = "my-workspace-name"
  organization = tfe_organization.test-organization.name
}

// create a policy that prevents automatic deletion of data in the test-workspace
resource "tfe_data_retention_policy" "foobar" {
  workspace_id = tfe_workspace.test-workspace.id

  dont_delete {}
}
```

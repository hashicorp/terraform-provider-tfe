# Data Source: tfe_project

Use this data source to get information about a project.

~> **NOTE:** The `WorkspaceIds` and `WorkspaceNames` attributes are not guaranteed to return values in the same order, so they cannot be reliably mapped to one another. To map workspace names to IDs reliably, it is recommended to pass those names into the `TfeWorkspaceIds` data source.

## Example Usage

```csharp
using Constructs;
using HashiCorp.Cdktf;
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
using Gen.Providers.Tfe;
class MyConvertedCode : TerraformStack
{
    public MyConvertedCode(Construct scope, string name) : base(scope, name)
    {
        new DataTfeProject.DataTfeProject(this, "foo", new DataTfeProjectConfig {
            Name = "my-project-name",
            Organization = "my-org-name"
        });
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
* `Name` - (Required) Name of the project.
* `Organization` - (Required) Name of the organization.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `Id` - The project ID.
* `WorkspaceIds` - IDs of the workspaces that are associated with the project.
* `WorkspaceNames` - Names of the workspaces that are associated with the project.
